# Lavorel-et-al-2024-Flow-rate_Exp
This repository hosts data and code associated with a series of laboratory experiments conducted in early 2024 at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Townsville, Australia). These experiments assess the environmental conditions, early coral recruit survival, and morphological responses of Acropora abrolhosensis to flow velocity gradients.

The repository is organized into four main folders, each with its own README for detailed documentation. Below is a brief overview of each component.
